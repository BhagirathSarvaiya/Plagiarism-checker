On March 24, 2000, the financial world changed. No, that was not the date this
book first hit the store shelves, but the beginning of a bear market that lasted
21⁄
2 years. Finally, I had bear market data to use for finding chart patterns!
After spending nearly 5 years recovering from the work needed to complete the first edition, I decided to undertake an update. I changed the editorial content of the book in small ways, but made substantial improvements in
others. Here is the list of the important changes:
• Bull and bear market statistics for complete coverage.
• Expanded statistics, all in a similar format:
Results Snapshot, at the start of each chapter shows the most
important numbers and surprises.
General statistics, including the average rise or decline, busted
pattern performance, and benchmark performance.
Failure rates, a list of ten breakpoints to show how often a pattern
fails.
Breakout and postbreakout statistics, showing performance
over the yearly price range, pullback rates, and performance after a
gap.
Frequency distribution of days to the ultimate high or low,
showing when the trend is likely to end.
Size statistics, describing how performance varies for pattern
height, width, and combinations of both.
Volume statistics, including volume trend, a new concept I call
volume shapes, and breakout day volume
