terns with downward breakouts fail to drop more than 15%. For upward
breakouts, patterns cross the halfway mark between rises of 15% and 25%.
These results suggest that you should not depend on a large rise or large
decline after a BB. Scanning down each row, we also see that BBs in bull markets
with upward breakouts have the lowest failure rates. Those are the ones to buy.
Another way to use Table 1.3 is to assess how likely it is that your trade
will fail. If you have a cost of trading of 5% and you want to make 20%, how
many patterns in a bull market with upward breakouts will fail to rise at least
25% (5 + 20)? Answer: 59%. Just 41% of the patterns will meet your profit Because there are many ways to express the same 
concept, the longer n becomes, the more unlikely it is that 
the same sequence of n tokens (words or characters) will 
appear in the same order in independently-written texts. 
Methods have varied between the use of fixed length 
substrings (commonly known as n-grams), variable-length 
substrings, or both (see, e.g. (Brin et al.,1995), 
(Shivakumar and Garcia-Molina,1996), (Lyon et al.,2001), 
and (Broder,1998)). The assumption that derived texts are 
unlikely to share matching sequences of consecutive 
tokens of length ≥ n rests upon the intuition that the way in 
which people express themselves varies from person to 
person. Even if writing about the same subject, it is unlikely 
that the topic will be expressed in exactly the same way 
(e.g. the same program structure or grammatical syntax), 
and using exactly the same words (i.e. the same 
vocabulary). As McEnery and Wilson (1996) state about 
finding the same sentence more than once: “unless it is a 
very formulaic sentence (such as those appearing as part 
of a legal disclaimer at the beginning of a book), it is deeply 
unlikely that you will find it repeated in its exact form in any 
book, in any library, anywhere” (McEnery and 
Wilson,1996:7)
