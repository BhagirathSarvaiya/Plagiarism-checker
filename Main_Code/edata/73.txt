minor lows and three minor highs. A five-point reversal is also rare: I located
only 5 in the 77 broadening bottoms I examined. The price trend begins moving down in late August and reaches a low 2 days before the formation begins.
Yes, prices do move up for several days, leading to the first touch of the top
trend line, but I still consider the overall price trend to be moving down to 
the formation. Price overshooting or undershooting the formation start is
common.
This particular chart pattern shows a partial decline. Prices move down another program with a small number of routine 
transformations.‚Äù These transformations might range from 
the simple (e.g. changing comments or variable names), to 
the more complex (e.g. replacing control structures with 
equivalents). Faidhi and Robinson (1987) characterise 
possible transformations in a spectrum ranging from no 
change (level 1) to the most complex changes (level 6). 
Identifying all possible changes a plagiarist is likely to use 
to disguise their copying would be infeasible, however 
changes in program code tend to fall into two categories 
(Joy and Luck,1999): 
(1) Lexical changes: edits that would, in principle, be 
performed using a simple text editor and require little 
knowledge of the programming language. In particular 
these edits would not require knowledge sufficient to 
parse a program. These changes might include 
rewording, adding or deleting comments, changing formatting and changing variable names (approximately 
levels 1-3 in Faidhi and Robinson (1987)).
