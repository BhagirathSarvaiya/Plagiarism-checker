SA and SB, is computed by summing elements of the 
intersection, T, of n-gram sets using a weighted function 
dependent on the length of n-gram i, leni. The sum is 
normalized with respect to set SA to create a subset or 
containment score. This score can be computed for various 
lengths of n (or leni) where the weighted score is used to 
give a higher similarity score to longer overlapping n-grams. 
If the weighting based on length is not used, the problem 
arises where a single overlapping n-gram of length 5 will 
receive the same score as 5 n-grams of length 1, but where 
even a single occurrence of an n-gram of length 5 words is 
much more significant and indicative of reuse than many 
single word matches. 
Two years later, Tom pulls up the stock chart. The dog has been flat for
so long it looks as if its heartbeat has stopped. He calls Jim and chats about the
outlook for JCB Superstores. Jim gushes enthusiastically about a new retailing
concept called the Internet. He is excited about the opportunity to sell office

because the online community is in its infancy, but Jim predicts it will expand
quickly. Tom is impressed, so he starts doing his homework and is soon buying the stock again.
