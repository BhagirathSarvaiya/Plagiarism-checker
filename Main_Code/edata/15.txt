Before reading about the various chart patterns in this book, it is wise to review
the performance of the stock market during the period. Figure I.1 shows a
monthly price chart of the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. Beginning in
mid-1991, you can see that the market moved up at a leisurely pace, pausing
during much of 1994, and then resuming the climb at a steeper angle in 1995.
The index stumbled in August 1998 and made lower lows for 2 more months
before continuing upward, peaking in March 2000, and signaling an end to the
bull market. The move capped a rise of 418% from the start of the period.
After that, the downhill bear run began, reaching a low in October 2002, for a
decline measuring 51%. The index bounced once but made a higher low in
March 2003, signaling a trend change. Thus, the October low marked the end
of the bear market.
What does all this mean? The bear market measures from March 24,
2000, to October 10, 2002—about 2.5 years long. For data collection purposes, the bull market is everything else, about 11 years long. That covers the
period I used to search for chart patterns in this edition
