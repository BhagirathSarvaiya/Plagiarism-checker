Notice how quickly the failure rates climb. For example, 16% of the rectangles in a bull market with downward breakouts fail to drop more than 5%.
This statistic skyrockets to 41% failing to drop more than 10%, and 60% drop
less than 15%!
Also, notice that the lowest failure rates accompany breakout directions
that are in line with the general marketâ€”bull market, upward breakouts and
bear market, downward breakouts. The countertrend rectangles (bear/up,
bull/down) have higher failure rates.
Here is another way to use the table. Suppose you have a rectangle with
a breakout price of 10 and it is 2.50 tall. The measure rule (discussed later in
the chapter) suggests a rise to 12.50 after an upward breakout. That is a 25%
move. How likely is that in a bear market? Answer: 64% will fail to rise that far.
Table 37.4 shows breakout- and postbreakout-related statistics.
Formation end to breakout. The move from the rectangle end to the
breakout is a quick one, averaging between 3 and 4 days.
Yearly position. Rectangles with upward breakouts occur most often in
the middle of the yearly trading range. Downward breakouts occur most often
within a third of the yearly low. Think about that information before you buy
a rectangle in a stock making new lows. The breakout may be downward,
emphasizing that bottom fishing (buying stocks making new lows because you
think they are poised to recover) is a difficult skill to master.
Yearly position, performance. Mapping performance over the yearly
price range gives mixed results because of the low sample counts. Rectangles
with upward breakouts have the best performance when the breakout is in the
middle of the yearly trading range. Downward breakouts do well when the
breakout is near the yearly low.
