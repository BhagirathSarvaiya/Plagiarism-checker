You are not alone; I did the same thing for years. I eventually got so frustrated with the performance of my stock selections that I decided to do my own
research on technical analysis. I went to the library and read the same thing in
many books: A head-and-shoulders formation works most of the time. What
does that mean? Does it mean they are successful 51% of the time or 90% of
the time? No one had the answer. I was not willing to risk my hard-earned dollars on simple bromides. As an engineer I wanted hard, cold facts, not fuzzy
platitudes. So, I wrote this book.
At the back of the book is an Index of Chart Patterns. If you suspect your
stock is making a chart pattern but do not know what to call it, the Index of statements and suicide notes. Over the years this approach 
has received considerable criticism from academics, due to 
its rather ad hoc underlying assumptions (see, e.g. Holmes 
and Tweedie (1995)). However there is evidence to suggest 
that this method does work well in some cases, and with 
certain changes can be made more reliable (see, e.g. 
(Somers,1998)). The question is whether or not the cusum 
approach can be used in plagiarism detection. 
The underlying assumption of the technique is that 
everyone has a unique set of quantifiable habits (this 
assumption has received the most criticism), e.g. noun 
usage, use of 2-3 letter words, words beginning with a 
vowel and use of function words. The claim is that when 
compared with the average sentence length, the rate of 
habit occurrence will be consistent. Any variation between 
the habit and average sentence length supposedly 
indicates multiple authorship. If you have ever been a board member, you know what I am talking about.
You have a fiduciary responsibility to the people who elected or appointed you
to that position. Not only should you study the material handed to you by the
staff, but you have to get out in the field and kick the tires. Do not assume that
what the staff says is always correct or represents the best solution. Question
everything but learn in the process and try to be helpful without being a pest
(I always seem to fall into the pest category). As a shareholder—an owner of the
company—should it be any different?
