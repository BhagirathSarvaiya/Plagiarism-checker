clauses, substitution of equivalent words or phrases, 
changes in form such as tense and voice (e.g. active to 
passive voice), making abstract ideas more concrete 
(specification), making concrete ideas more abstract 
(generalisation), merging or separating sentences (either 
adjacent or dispersed throughout the original) and rewriting 
direct quotes as indirect (and vice-versa). Rewriting a text 
will invariably include paraphrasing: a form of rewriting in 
which the meaning of the original phrase or sentence is 
preserved, but the way in which the meaning is expressed 
is changed. 
Other forms of plagiarism include submitting someone 
else’s work (or copying it directly), failing to reference/ 
footnote source material and copying a collection of 
paragraphs from a variety of electronic sources and pasting 
them together into a coherent whole. This is known as an 
‘Internet pastiche’ or ‘patchwork plagiarism’. I no longer
follow but that have historical data of limited duration (some issues no 
longer trade).
For rare chart patterns, I use all three databases and search from 1991 to
the most recent date available. For plentiful patterns, I use already found patterns and add those appearing during the bear market. Thus, the number of
stocks I use to find patterns and the amount of historical price quotes varies.
In the first edition of this book, I used a combination of computerized
algorithms and manual searching to find chart patterns. The current edition
