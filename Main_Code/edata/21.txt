69%? Answer: No. Why not? Well, you may be like a friend of mine who has
traded stocks a dozen times but made money only once (a few hundred bucks).
But here is another reason: The 69% average rise represents 253 perfect trades.
A perfect trade is one in which you buy at the breakout price and sell at the ultimate high—the highest high before prices decline by at least 20%. Not only
are the trades perfect, but also commissions are not included. Your return may
be lower . . . or higher. However, I used the same spreadsheet formulas from
pattern to pattern, so you can compare performance in most cases (the exceptions: flags, measured moves, and pennants) without worrying about whether
you believe the numbers.
“If I reproduce your tests, will I get similar results?” Yes. A person in
India I know is pulling 30%, 40%, and more out of the market on a consistent
basis. He would claim my statistics are too conservative! A hedge fund manager
reports that my numbers for the dead-cat bounce are dead solid perfect.
Another says that while she was able to reproduce my dead-cat bounce numbers, she was having trouble reproducing others. If you do not follow the
methods I used, your results will vary. Guaranteed. So, this edition includes a
Glossary and Methodology chapter to explain how I measured each result.
The method I used opened a door to a new world. In this world, you will
find that a month after a breakout in a bear market, price often shows strength.
You will discover that when pullbacks occur, performance suffers. You will find
that failure rates start low but increase rapidly. Volume shapes, price gaps, pattern size, and a dozen other performance clues help some patterns but not others. Findings like these are what make this book unique. The numbers tell a
story of fact that I share with you within the following pages.
