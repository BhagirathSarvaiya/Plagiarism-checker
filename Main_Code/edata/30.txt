terns with downward breakouts fail to drop more than 15%. For upward
breakouts, patterns cross the halfway mark between rises of 15% and 25%.
These results suggest that you should not depend on a large rise or large
decline after a BB. Scanning down each row, we also see that BBs in bull markets
with upward breakouts have the lowest failure rates. Those are the ones to buy.
Another way to use Table 1.3 is to assess how likely it is that your trade
will fail. If you have a cost of trading of 5% and you want to make 20%, how
many patterns in a bull market with upward breakouts will fail to rise at least
25% (5 + 20)? Answer: 59%. Just 41% of the patterns will meet your profit
margins. Since the majority will fail, your winners must do quite well to compensate for the losses.
Table 1.4 shows statistics related to BB performance after the breakout.
Formation end to breakout. There is a delay between price touching
the trend line the final time and closing above it. This delay averages between
3 weeks and 5 weeks. It takes longer to break out in a bull market than a bear
market because the decline in a bear market is often steeper.
Yearly position. Most of the breakouts occur near the yearly low. This
makes sense for downward breakouts, especially those in bear markets. The
only exception is in bull markets. They show 44% of the breakouts occurring
in the middle of the yearly price range.
Yearly position, performance. In most entries, the sample counts are
few, making the results unreliable. Those BBs with breakouts following the
market trend (bull market, up breakout and bear market, down breakout) do
best when the breakout is near the yearly high.
Throwbacks and pullbacks. The throwback/pullback rate hovers
around 43% except for BBs in a bear market with a downward breakout. They
pullback 56% of the time. Still, the rates are too low to use in forming a reliable trading strategy
