As Table 37.2 predicted (see “Days to ultimate high or low”), RBs in a
bear market with a downward breakout show the quickest decline, with 55%
reaching the ultimate low in less than 3 weeks. At the other end of the scale,
14% are still searching for the ultimate low after 70 days.
What do the numbers mean? Table 37.5 shows how likely your rectangle
will top/bottom out over time. Rectangles with upward breakouts will take
longer to reach the ultimate high than those with downward breakouts. In a
bear market, RBs show strength at day 56, so if you short a stock, you may need
to close out your position in weeks 7 to 9.
Table 37.6 shows statistics related to size.
Height. Tall patterns perform better than short ones. For example, tall
rectangles in bull markets with upward breakouts rise 66% after the breakout.
Rectangles shorter than the median show postbreakout rises of just 34%.
Width. Usually, wide patterns perform better than narrow ones, but the
difference is slight. The exception is for rectangles in bear markets with
upward breakouts. Narrow rectangles show rises of 25% and wide ones rise
24% after the breakout. I used the median width as the separator between narrow and wide.
Average formation length. The average rectangle length was about 78
days except for those in a bear market with a downward breakout. They averaged 58 days long. I set a minimum length of about 2 weeks because short rectangles are better classified as flags.
Height and width combinations. Looking at the combination of height
and width, you would expect patterns both tall and wide to perform best
because those traits do well individually. Table 37.6 shows that is indeed the
case if you overlook the low sample count results (the 85% rise for rectangles
in bull markets, upward breakouts used 18 samples, and the 41% rise in bear
markets, upward breakouts had 9 samples).
