declines over 45%. Outstanding performance is rare for BBs.
The best showing comes from upward breakouts in a bull market, with 20% of
the patterns climbing more than 45%. That may sound like a lot, but other
patterns do much better. Thus, do not expect a large move. Downward breakouts almost never fare well in this category.
Change after trend ends. In a bull market, once prices reach the ultimate low after a downward breakout, prices rise an average of 51%. Even in a
bear market, the climb measures 46%. Thus, if you can determine when the
downtrend ends, buy the stock and surf the rising tide.
Busted pattern performance. Few patterns bust, so the performance
numbers are not solid. Still, they show how much better a busted pattern does Methods have also been developed to visualise the 
similarity between texts including VAST (Culwin and 
Lancaster,2001), Dotplot (Church and Helfman,1996), 
Bandit8
 and Duploc (Ducasse et al.,1999). For more 
information about plagiarism detection, see (Clough, 2000). 
4. Example plagiarism detection methods for 
natural language 
Two approaches for detecting plagiarism in natural 
language texts will now be discussed. The main focus of 
my research has been measuring text reuse in journalism. 
In most cases this would represent reuse by an 
experienced plagiarist (i.e. the newsworker) with a high 
level of editing skill and excellent command of the English 
language. More recently I have been experimenting with 
methods to detect stylistic inconsistency across a single 
text. This inconsistency may indicate that different authors 
may have been involved with its creation. 
4.1. Measuring similarity between multiple texts 
One method of plagiarism detection which has proven to be 
successful in a number of applications is finding the overlap 
of matching subsequences and substrings (consecutive 
tokens) of length â‰¥ n (where n is derived empirically).
