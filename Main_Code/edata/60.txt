Other forms, such as paraphrasing and the reuse of 
structure can also be identified relatively easily, but get 
progressively harder as the plagiarist uses more complex 
rewrites or to hide the original text, or reuses only ideas and

plagiarism are not just harder to detect, but also harder to 
prove.

Real examples of student plagiarism are hard to come by 
due to restrictions in student confidentiality. However, many 
on-line sources exist that provide examples of what 
constitutes student plagiarism. The simplest form of 
plagiarism is to directly copy from a source text with 
minimum rewriting. This type of text reuse is common in 
student plagiarism (Martin,1994) where entire passages are 
copied word-for-word directly from the source. For example, 
consider the following rewrite from the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison Writing Centre3 Jim is struggling.
He is the owner of JCB Superstores and his competitor across town is
beating him up; there is blood all over Jim’s ledger. He decides it is time to take

With a growing sales base, Jim’s clout allows him to negotiate lower
prices for the office supplies he is retailing. He passes on part of the savings to
his customers, while watching his margins widen, and plows the profits back
into building more stores.
Jim calls his friend, Tom, and tells him of his plans to expand the operation statewide. They chat for a while and exchange business tactics on how best
