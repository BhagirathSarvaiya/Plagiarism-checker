slowly climbed and reached a minor high of 13.13 before heading down again.
This time the decline was strong enough to punch through the support zone
at the lower trend line.
When the stock descended below point B, Susan lowered her stop-loss
order to 0.15 above that point or 12.15. Then she looked at the measure rule
for the price target. She calculated a target of 9.88 and wondered if the stock
would really reach that price. To be safe, she decided to cash out if the stock
reached 10.15, or 0.15 above the common support price of 10 (a whole number typically shows support).
When the stock plunged to 10.38 on high volume, she wondered if she
was looking at a one-day reversal chart pattern. With those formations, it is
difficult to be sure if prices would reverse or not. She decided to hold on to her
original target.
Two days later, prices zoomed upward and her stop closed out the trade
at 12.15. She did not make much money (about 9% with a hold time of just
over a month), but she gained experience and a few pennies to put in the bank.
