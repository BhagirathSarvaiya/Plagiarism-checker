An example of text reuse with which I have been involved 
more closely with lies within the domain of journalism. It is 
common knowledge within the newspaper industry that 
most newspapers rely heavily upon press agencies as their 
primary source of ‘pre-fabricated’ news material 
(Bell,1996:20-22). This is a form of plagiarism, but ‘benign’. 
As regular subscribers to news agency services, media 
organisations pay an annual fee which entitles them to 
reuse the agency source text in any way they see fit, either 
verbatim, or editing it to suit their own production 
requirements. In many cases, the final attribution of the 
news story goes to the journalist or newspaper and not the 
news agency, but this is perfectly acceptable. As an 
example, consider the following. 
Original (news agency): 
A Chief Constable's daughter who assaulted two officers in her 
father's force after drinking a litre of strong cider was today 
sentenced to 150 hours community service. 
Rewrite (The Sun - popular press): 
A Top Cop's daughter who assaulted two of her Dad's 
officers after downing a litre of cider was sentenced to 150 
hours' community service yesterday. 
Rewrite (The Independent - quality press): 
The daughter of the Chief Constable of Sussex was
sentenced to 150 hours' community service yesterday.

bull market. The move capped a rise of 418% from the start of the period.
After that, the downhill bear run began, reaching a low in October 2002, for a
decline measuring 51%. The index bounced once but made a higher low in
March 2003, signaling a trend change. Thus, the October low marked the end
of the bear market.
What does all this mean? The bear market measures from March 24,
2000, to October 10, 2002—about 2.5 years long. For data collection purposes, the bull market is everything else, about 11 years long. That covers the
period I used to search for chart patterns in this edition
