Broadening bottoms (BBs) are middle-of-the-road performers, sporting a 9%
break-even failure rate except in bull markets when double digits prevail (a
poor showing). The average rise or decline is also below that posted by other
chart pattern types.
Surprises are many and a few appear in the snapshot. I discuss them in
more detail later.
Tour One of many challenges in automatic plagiarism detection 
is the selection of suitable discriminators that reflect 
plagiarism and not co-incidental similarity due to content or 
theme. So far the focus has been on lexical and structural 
similarity in both program code and natural language, but 
these become less effective when the degree of rewriting or 
form of plagiarism becomes more complex. Three areas to 
address in automatic plagiarism detection include the 
following: 
(1) Finding suitable discriminators of plagiarism which 
can be quantified. 
(2) Developing suitable methods to compare those 
discriminators. 
(3) Finding suitable measures of similarity. 
The goal of an automatic plagiarism detection system is to 
assist manual detection by: reducing the amount of time 
spent comparing texts, making comparison between large 
numbers of multiple texts feasible and finding possible 
source texts from electronic resources available to the 
system. The systems must minimise the number of false 
positives (those incorrectly classed as plagiarised) and 
false negatives (those incorrectly classed as nonplagiarised), and maximize the number of true positives 
(those correctly classed as plagiarised) and true negatives 
(those correctly classed as non-plagiarised)
