Average formation length. The average width is between 1 and 2
months long.
Height and width combinations. Tall and narrow patterns outperform
the other combinations. You will want to avoid short and wide patterns. They
perform worst.
Table 1.7 shows volume-related statistics for broadening bottoms. The
sample counts are few in this table, so the conclusions you reach may change
with a larger sample size.
Volume trend. Up breakouts do better when the volume trend is falling,
and downward breakouts do better with a rising volume trend.
Volume shapes. In all cases, a random volume shape—neither U- nor
dome-shaped—performed better than the other shapes. A random shape
includes flat, rising (trending up), and falling (trending down) volume trends.
Breakout volume. Patterns in bear markets perform better after a heavy
volume breakout. The other two columns either show no difference or show
