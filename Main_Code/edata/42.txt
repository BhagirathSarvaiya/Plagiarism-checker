a third (42%) of the RBs in a bull market with upward breakouts show rises
over 45%. The worst performance comes from RBs in a bull market with
downward breakouts. Just 3% show declines over 45%.
Change after trend ends. Table 37.2 shows what happens when price
reaches the ultimate high or low after the breakout. The best recovery occurs in
a bull market with a downward breakout. After reaching bottom, prices recover
by an average of 62%. The worst performance comes after an upward breakout
from a rectangle in a bull market. Once price tops out, it declines 28%.
Busted pattern performance. Busted pattern performance is unremarkable. When you consider that you will not buy in at the top of the move or sell at
the exact bottom, the performance is even worse. Plus, busted patterns are rare.
Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 change. Compare the size of the market move
with the average rise or decline. When the general market and the breakout
directions were synchronized, the move was larger (bull market, upward breakout and bear market, downward breakout). Countertrend moves were smaller.
This bears repeating: Trade with the market trend.
Days to ultimate high or low. It takes price 33 days to drop 25% (bear
market, down breakout), but it takes 177 days to rise 46% (bull market, up
breakout). Both flow with the general market current, and yet the bull market
takes five times as long to move less than twice as far. The decline must be
steeper in a bear market than is the rise in a bull market, a scenario we have
seen with other chart patterns.
Table 37.3 shows failure rates for RBs. For small moves, RBs in a bear
market (downward breakout) do best, with just 4% failing to drop at least 5%.
By the time the drop reaches 15%, RBs in a bull market with upward breakouts
will have the lower failure rates
