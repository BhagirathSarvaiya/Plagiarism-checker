Throwbacks and pullbacks. When you trade against the prevailing
market trend, a throwback or pullback is more likely to occur. With the market trend, throwbacks or pullbacks occur 53% of the time.
The average time to complete a throwback or pullback is 9 days. When a
throwback or pullback occurs, performance suffers.
Gaps. Rectangles have few breakout day gaps. For rectangles with
upward breakouts, gaps helped performance (but the sample size was small).
For downward breakouts, gaps did not change performance much.
Table 37.5 shows a frequency distribution of time to the ultimate high or
low. Notice how many RBs reach their targets in the first 2 or 3 weeks. For
example, 54% (the sum of the first 3 weeks) of RBs with downward breakouts
in a bull market reach the ultimate low in less than 3 weeks. Just 20% of RBs
with upward breakouts in a bull market hit their targets in 3 weeks. They take
considerably longer to reach the ultimate high (63% are still searching after 2.5
months
