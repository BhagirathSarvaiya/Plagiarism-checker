Shape. The shape of the formation is distinct. It reminds me of chaos
theory where small disturbances oscillate back and forth, then grow unbounded, wreaking havoc. In the stock market, price reaches a new high then
crosses over and makes a new low, creating the broadening pattern. When you
draw a trend line across the minor highs and another connecting the minor
lows, the formation looks like a megaphone.
Trend lines. The two trend lines drawn across the minor highs and lows
are important. The top trend line should slope up; the bottom one should
slope down. The diverging trend lines distinguish the broadening bottom from
other types of formations, such as the right-angled broadening formation
(which has one horizontal trend line) or the broadening wedge (both trend
lines slope in the same direction). So it is important that each trend line has a
slope that is opposite the other.
Touches. A broadening bottom needs at least two minor highs and two
minor lows to be a valid formation. Anything fewer means you are incorrectly
identifying the formation. What is a minor high or low? A minor high is when
prices trend up, then drop back down, leaving a clearly defined peak. A minor
low is just the same thing flipped upside down: Prices move lower, then head
back up leaving a clearly defined valley. Figure 1.1 shows five minor highs or
lows, labeled by numbers. The odd numbers tag the minor highs and the even
numbers are the minor lows. Let me stress that the minor highs and lows need
not be alternating, as in Figure 1.1. Just as long as you can count at least two
peaks and two valleys—wherever they may appear—that is fine
