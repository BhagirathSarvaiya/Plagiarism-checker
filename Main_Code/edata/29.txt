declines over 45%. Outstanding performance is rare for BBs.
The best showing comes from upward breakouts in a bull market, with 20% of
the patterns climbing more than 45%. That may sound like a lot, but other
patterns do much better. Thus, do not expect a large move. Downward breakouts almost never fare well in this category.
Change after trend ends. In a bull market, once prices reach the ultimate low after a downward breakout, prices rise an average of 51%. Even in a
bear market, the climb measures 46%. Thus, if you can determine when the
downtrend ends, buy the stock and surf the rising tide.
Busted pattern performance. Few patterns bust, so the performance
numbers are not solid. Still, they show how much better a busted pattern does
than one that works. If you see prices move less than 5% after the breakout and
then return to the pattern, consider trading the new direction, but only if it
breaks out the other side.
Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 change. Compare the change in the index with
the average rise or decline. Large moves in the index associate with large moves
in the stock. For best performance, trade with the market trend (bull markets,
upward breakouts and bear markets, downward breakouts).
Days to ultimate high or low. It takes between a month to 4 months to
reach the ultimate high or low. The numbers say that the move in a bear market takes less time than in a bull market. Thus, the decline after a BB in a bear
market must be at a steeper slope than is the rise in a bull market.
Table 1.3 shows failure rates for BBs. The 5% break-even failure rate is
lowest in a bear market (9%). The failure rates climb quickly as the maximum
price rise or decline changes. For the 10% failure rate benchmark, BBs fail
between two and three times more often than at the 5% rate. Over half the pat
