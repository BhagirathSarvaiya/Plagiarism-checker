Jim is struggling.
He is the owner of JCB Superstores and his competitor across town is
beating him up; there is blood all over Jim’s ledger. He decides it is time to take
off the gloves: JCB goes public. He uses the money from the initial public
offering to buy his competitor and add a few more stores around town.
With a growing sales base, Jim’s clout allows him to negotiate lower
prices for the office supplies he is retailing. He passes on part of the savings to
his customers, while watching his margins widen, and plows the profits back
into building more stores.
Jim calls his friend, Tom, and tells him of his plans to expand the operation statewide. They chat for a while and exchange business tactics on how best
to manage the expansion. When Tom gets off the phone, he decides to conduct his own research on JCB. He visits several stores and sees the same thing:
packed parking lots, people bustling around with full shopping carts, and lines
at the checkout counters. He questions a few customers to get a sense of the
demographics. At a few stores, he even chats with suppliers as they unload their
wares. Back at the office, he does a thorough analysis of the financials and
looks at the competition. Everything checks out so he orders his trading partners to buy the stock at no higher than 10.
When news of the expansion plan hits the wires, the Street panics. It is,
after all, a soft economy and expanding willy-nilly when a recession looms is
daft, maybe even criminal, according to the pundits. The stock drops below 10
and Tom’s crew makes its move. They buy as much as they can without raising suspicion. The stock rises anyway. It goes back up to 11, then 12, and
rounds over at 13 before heading back down
