Volume trend. Most of the time, rectangles with a rising volume trend
perform better than do those with a falling volume trend. The only exception
comes from rectangles in a bear market with a downward breakout.
Volume shapes. Rectangles with a random—neither U nor dome—volume shape performed best most of the time. The sample counts are very low
so it might be best to ignore the results. If you do that, then the best performance comes from patterns having U-shaped volume. The exception is rectangles in bull markets with upward breakouts: They do best with dome-shaped
volume.
Breakout volume. Heavy breakout volume works best when the breakout is in the direction of the prevailing price trend—bull market, upward
breakouts and bear market, downward breakouts. They perform better or substantially better than rectangles with breakout volume below the 30-day average. Countertrend RBs showed mixed results.
Table 37.8 shows miscellaneous statistics for RBs.
Partial rise or decline. If you are not familiar with a partial rise or
decline, consult the figures and associated text in the Glossary and Methodology chapter. Partial rises and declines are reliable predictors of breakout direction. For example, an upward breakout follows a partial decline 81% of the
