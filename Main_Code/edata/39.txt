Before I began studying this formation, I assumed prices would climb away
from it, simply because the word ascending is in the title. However, that is not
how the formation performs. It is bearish. The word ascending refers to the
minor highs that rise over time. The base of this formation is flat but the tops
generally follow an up-sloping trend line.
Surprises for this pattern include throwbacks and pullbacks that hurt performance when they occur. They interrupt price momentum. Tall patterns
perform better than short ones, and for upward breakouts, patterns both tall
and wide perform better than other combinations.

Figure 2.1 puts the formation in perspective. There are two formations shown
in the chart. The first one is somewhat ill-formed but better performing than
the second. Both formations have a base outlined by a horizontal trend line connecting the minor lows. The up-sloping trend line skirts the tops of the minor
highs. The result is a triangle-appearing formation with prices that broaden out,
but do not let the ascending price pattern fool you. This formation is bearish:
Prices plummet through the base of the formation most of the time.
Why do right-angled ascending broadening formations form? Consider
Figure 2.2. The rise began in mid-December 1991 on volume that was higher
than anything seen in almost 2 months. By late February, the stock had reached
a new high and was rounding over after meeting selling resistance at 14. The
stock returned to 12.25 where it found support. At that point, it paused for
