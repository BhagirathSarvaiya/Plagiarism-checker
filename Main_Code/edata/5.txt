When I was a little tyke I decided the easiest way to riches was to play the stock
market. It was, after all, a level playing field, a negative-sum game with somebody winning and somebody losing. (Hint: The winner is always the broker.)
All one had to do to win was pick stocks that went up and avoid stocks that
went down. Easy.
I kept this in mind when I graduated from Syracuse University with an
engineering degree and showed up early for my first professional job. Each

Lest you think that everything was easy, consider what happened. My
stock portfolio was growing by leaps and bounds, but my professional career
was about to take a turn for the worse. After switching careers more often than
