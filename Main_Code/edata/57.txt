Hannabuss (2001) defines plagiarism as the “unauthorised 
use or close imitation of the ideas and language/ 
expression of someone else and involves representing their 
work as your own.” Plagiarism is closely linked with 
intellectual property and copyright, both of which are set in 
place to protect the ownership of texts through the creativity 
and originality of their contents. As Osen (1997) comments: 
“if plagiarism is the bane of the academic world, copyright 
infringement is the scourge of the legal one.” Copyright law, 
however, does not protect ideas, themes or subject matter;

bitter taste” (Hannabuss,2001). In education, students may 
plagiarise to gain a qualification; academics to gain 
popularity and status. If a plagiarism relationship exists 
between two texts, it suggests that the texts exhibit some 
degree of intertextuality, which wo You are not alone; I did the same thing for years. I eventually got so frustrated with the performance of my stock selections that I decided to do my own
research on technical analysis. I went to the library and read the same thing in
many books: A head-and-shoulders formation works most of the time. What
does that mean? Does it mean they are successful 51% of the time or 90% of
the time? No one had the answer. I was not willing to risk my hard-earned dollars on simple bromides. As an engineer I wanted hard, cold facts, not fuzzy
platitudes. So, I wrote this book.
At the back of the book is an Index of Chart Patterns. If you suspect your
