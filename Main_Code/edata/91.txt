Statistics
Table 37.2 shows general statistics for RBs.
Number of formations. I searched through 500 stocks from mid-1991
to mid-1996 and another 500 from 2000 to 2003 to capture the bear market. I
found fewer RBs than I hoped, 374, split between market conditions and
breakout directions.
Reversal or continuation. Since rectangle bottoms must have price
entering the pattern from the top, an upward breakout represents a reversal of
the price trend, and a downward breakout is a continuation. If you do the math
using the numbers in Table 37.2, you will find that RBs act as consolidations
of the price trend 55% of the time.
Average rise or decline. The best performance from RBs comes in a bull
market with an upward breakout. In fact, when the breakout is in the same
direction as the general market, the pattern performs better. For example, RBs
in a bear market with downward breakouts show declines averaging 25%, but
those in a bull market decline an average of just 14%. This behavior shows the
marketâ€™s influence, and it reinforces the belief that you should trade with the
general market trend.
Rises or declines over 45%. Bullish chart patterns always do better than
bearish ones for large moves. This is true, in part, because of the math. A stock
can double or triple, but a stock cannot lose more than 100% of its value. Ove
