Volume. There is nothing magical in the volume trend. I performed linear regression from the start of each formation to the end point (not the breakout point that is usually a month beyond the end of the formation) and found
that volume rises about 57% of the time.

Identification Characteristics of Broadening Bottoms
Characteristic Discussion
Price trend The short-term price trend should be downward leading to the
formation.
Shape Megaphone shape with higher highs and lower lows.
Trend lines Prices follow two trend lines: The top one slopes up and the bottom
one slopes down.
Touches Should have at least two minor highs and two minor lows, but not
necessarily alternating touches.
Volume The overall trend is usually upward, sometimes with a U shape.
Breakout A breakout occurs when price closes above the formation’s high
(upward breakout) or below the pattern’s low (downward breakout).
See text for details. The breakout can occur in either direction and
prices may move horizontally for several months before staging a
definitive breakout.
4366_01.qxd 2/23/05 11:28 AM Page 14If you look closely at broadening bottoms, you will find that volume sometimes follows price. In Figure 1.1, the price decline between peak 1 and trough
2 shows a receding volume trend. When prices head up from point 2 to point 3,
so does volume. If you were to place a thin wooden plank between the volume
peaks in late November and late January, it would bow downward in a U shape.
A U-shaped volume pattern occurs slightly more often than other shapes.
