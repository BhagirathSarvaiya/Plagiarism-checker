Volume. There is nothing magical in the volume trend. I performed linear regression from the start of each formation to the end point (not the breakout point that is usually a month beyond the end of the formation) and found
that volume rises about 57% of the time.

Price trend The short-term price trend should be downward leading to the
formation.
Shape Megaphone shape with higher highs and lower lows.
Trend lines Prices follow two trend lines: The top one slopes up and the bottom
one slopes down Empirical investigation has shown that measures of 
similarity derived from attribute-counting measures cannot 
capture the structure of a program sufficiently to distinguish 
plagiarised from non-plagiarised texts (c.f. (Faidhi and 
Robinson,1987), (Whale,1990) and (Wise,1992)). This has 
led to the creation of ‘structure-based’ methods which 
compare string representations of program structure 
directly, rather than measures derived from the structure. 
Programs are typically converted into a string representtation, which might involve some knowledge of the target 
language, e.g. tokenisation, or more language-dependent 
methods, such as parsing. The aim of this stage is to 
reduce the effect of differences due to systematic changes
