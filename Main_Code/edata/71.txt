69%? Answer: No. Why not? Well, you may be like a friend of mine who has
traded stocks a dozen times but made money only once (a few hundred bucks).
But here is another reason: The 69% average rise represents 253 perfect trades.
A perfect trade is one in which you buy at the breakout price and sell at the ultimate high—the highest high before prices decline by at least 20%. Not only
are the trades perfect, but also commissions are not included. Your return may
be lower . . .  the same content but paraphrased. This is reflected by the 
increase in on-line services (e.g. Plagiarism.org and 
turnitin.com) to address plagiarism from available on-line 
resources, particularly term paper mills which can supply 
pre-made essays to students for a given fee. Services to 
track and monitor commercial content have also received 
increased popularity as the media report more cases of 
stolen digital content (e.g. contentguard.com). 
Whale (1990) suggests that “the task [of automatic 
plagiarism detection] may be simplified by finding a 
distinctive characteristic such as a misspelled identifier or 
paraphrased comment, though such a capability is hard to 
build into any automated plagiarism detection system.” To 
identify more complex forms of plagiarism beyond cut-andpaste or simple rewriting is hard, particularly for natural 
language, therefore automatic plagiarism detection 
generally involves finding quantifiable discriminators which 
can be used to measure the similarity between texts. 
Rather than identify more complex plagiarism, the 
automatic methods aim to highlight potentially derived texts 
through “unusual” or unlikely similarity enabling further 
manual inspection where more complex forms can be 
found.
