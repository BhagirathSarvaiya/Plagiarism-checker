If you have ever worked on a car or done some woodworking, then you
will recognize the importance of selecting the right tool for the job. You would
not want to use a flat-head screwdriver when a Phillips works better. Both do
the job but they are hardly interchangeable. Sometimes it is not a screwdriver
you should be using, but a chisel. Selecting the proper tools and knowing how
to use them is half the battle. This book is a lot like that, helping to sort the
wheat from the chaff. Sometimes a chart pattern is frightening enough that you
will want to take profits. At other times, the best trade that you can make is
none at all.
I cannot give you the experience needed to make money in the stock market using chart patterns. I can only give you the tools and say, “Go to work on
paper first.” That is the first step in developing a trading style that works for
you, one you are comfortable with, one that improves as you do. If you review
your paper trades, you will understand why a stop-loss order is more than a
tool for the professionals. You will improve your ability to predict support and
resistance levels that will, in turn, allow you to tighten your stops and get out
near the top, cut your losses short, and let your profits run. You will understand why the statistics in this book are useful for comparison purposes, but
your trading results may fall short. You may discover that your girlfriend loves
diamonds, but as a chart pattern, they are a lousy investment. One word says it
all. Experience.
Good luck.
