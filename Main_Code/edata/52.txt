eedback processes abound in nature and, over the last few decades, the word feedback, like 
computer, has found its way into our language far more pervasively than most others of technological 
origin. The conceptual framework for the theory of feedback and that of the discipline in which it is 
embedded-control systems engineering-have developed only since World War 11. When our first 
edition was published, in 1967, the subject of linear continuous-time (or analog) control systems had 
already attained a high level of maturity, and it was (and remains) often designated classical control by 
the conoscienti. This was also the early development period for the digital computer and discrete-time 
data control processes and applications, during which courses and books in " sampled-data" control 
systems became more prevalent. Computer-controlled and digital control systems are now the terminology of choice for control systems that include digital computers or microprocessors. 
In this second edition, as in the first, we present a concise, yet quite comprehensive, treatment of 
the fundamentals of feedback and control system theory and applications, for engineers, physical, 
biological and behavioral scientists, economists, mathematicians and students of these disciplines. 
Knowledge of basic calculus, and some physics are the only prerequisites. The necessary mathematical 
tools beyond calculus, and the physical and nonphysical principles and models used in applications, are 
developed throughout the text and in the numerous solved problems
