below 30.38. At its lowest point, it closes at 29.88. That is just fifty cents below
the low, but it is enough to signal a downward breakout. Within a week of
moving below the formation low, prices shoot to 33 and continue up using a
slower trajectory.
Figure 1.3 represents what I call a 5% failure. Prices break out lower but
fail to continue moving in the breakout direction by more than 5% before
heading back up. The reverse is also true for upward 5% failures: Prices move
up by less than 5% before turning around and tumbling.
Statistics
Table 1.2 shows general statistics for the broadening bottom chart pattern.
Number of formations. I found 237 patterns in 500 stocks using data
from mid 1991 to 2004.
Reversal or continuation. You can see that more patterns act as reversals than continuations. By definition, a bottom pattern has prices entering
from the top and exiting any way it darn well pleases.
In a bull market, reversals outperform continuations, but in a bear market, the situation reverses: continuations outperform reversals.
Average rise or decline. Notice how upward breakout performance
improves in a bull market and downward breakout performance is better in a
bear market. Think of it as a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is an example
of how trading with the prevailing market trend will improve your results.
