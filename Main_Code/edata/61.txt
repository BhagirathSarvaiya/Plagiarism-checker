“How important is our power of non-analytical thought to the 
practice of science? It's the most important thing we have, 
declares the Princeton physicist historian Thomas Kuhn who 
argues that major breakthroughs occur only after scientists 
finally concede that certain physical phenomena cannot be 
explained by extending the logic of old theories. Consider 
the belief that the sun and the planets move around the 
earth, which reigned prior to 1500. This idea served nicely 
for a number of centuries, but then became too cumbersome 
to describe the motions of heavenly bodies. So the Polish 
astronomer Copernicus invented a new reality that was 
based on a totally different ‘paradigm’ or model - that the 
earth and planets move around the sun”. 
Plagiarised version: 
Non-analytic thought is considered very important to the 
practice of science by Princeton physicist historian 
Thomas Kuhn who claims that major breakthroughs
happen only when scientists finally concede that some 
physical phenomena defy explanation by extending the 
logic of old theories. One idea which served nicely for 
many centuries but then became too cumbersome was the 
belief that the sun and planets revolved around the earth. 
This was held prior to 1500 until Copernicus invented a 
new reality: the earth and planets move around the sun. 
When the
stock recovers to its old high, his trading partners sell the remainder of their
holdings. The stock tops out and rounds over. During the next month and a
half, the stock drifts down, slowly, casually. There does not appear to be a rush
for the exits—just a slow trickle as the smart money quietly folds up shop.
Then news of poor holiday sales leaks out. There is a rumor about distribution problems, merchandising mistakes, and cash flow problems. Brokerage
firms that only weeks before were touting the stock now advise their clients to
sell. The stock plummets 39% overnight.
