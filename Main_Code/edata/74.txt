Shape. The shape of the formation is distinct. It reminds me of chaos
theory where small disturbances oscillate back and forth, then grow unbounded, wreaking havoc. In the stock market, price reaches a new high then
crosses over and makes a new low, creating the broadening pattern. When you
draw a trend line across the minor highs and another connecting the minor
lows, the formation looks like a megaphone.
Trend lines. The two trend lines drawn across the minor highs and lows
are important. The top trend line should slope up; the bottom one should
slope down. The diverging trend lines distinguish the broadening bottom from
other types of formations, such as the right-angled broadening formation Structural changes: these changes require 
knowledge of the programming language to the extent 
of being able to change the structure so that the 
program still parses. This is highly language dependent and might include replacement of equivalent 
iteration structures or operand ordering (approximately 
levels 4-6 in Faidhi and Robinson (1987)). 
Two major approaches have emerged for plagiarism 
detection in program code (e.g. (Whale,1990) and (Verco 
and Wise, 1996)): (1) attribute-counting, and (2) 
structure-based. The earliest systems (e.g. 
(Ottenstein,1976)) counted program attributes such as 
metrics of software science5
, the number of tokens, 
distribution of identifiers and other author or program 
specific characteristics. These scores were collected into a 
vector called a profile and a distance measure, e.g. 
Euclidean distance, used to determine the degree of 
closeness between profiles. Many attributes have been 
tried, but an attribute-counting method with consistent 
results is still to be found. The difficulty of choosing an 
appropriate set of metrics, so far, has been an insoluble 
problem associated with this approach.
