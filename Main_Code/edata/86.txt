I sometimes like to admit, I landed a job with a company I could finally call
homeâ€”a job that would last a lifetime, or so I hoped. Almost 6 months after

identifying inconsistencies within it. These might be stylistic 
(e.g. use of particular words), grammatical (e.g. use of

inconsistencies in collaborative writing (see, e.g. (Glover 
and Hirst,1995)). The latter is particularly interesting as this 
task first involves identifying inconsistencies before 
recommendations can be made to correct the style. Typical 
indicators of style include average sentence length, 
distribution of word classes, verb forms, nominal forms (e.g. 
gerunds), vocabulary richness and frequency of passive 
voice. Indicators of style can be derived from un-analysed 
text, tagged text, parsed text or interpreted text.
