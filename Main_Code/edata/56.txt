e.g. (Bull et al.,2001) and (Culwin and Lancaster,2000)), 
examples of plagiarism (see, e.g. (Mallon,1989)), reasoning 
behind student plagiarism (see, e.g. JISC), or guidance for 
writers on how to prevent themselves unintentionally 
plagiarising their sources. So what is plagiarism? 
2.1. The problem of plagiarism 
“The wrong in plagiarism lies in misrepresenting that a 
text originated from the person claiming to be its 
author when that person knows very well that it was 
derived from another source, knows that the reader is

Joy and Luck (1999) define plagiarism as “unacknowledged copying of documents or programs” that can “occur 
in many contexts: in industry a company may seek 
competitive advantage; in academia academics may seek 
to publish their research in advance of their colleagues.” 
Most empirical study and analysis has been undertaken by 
the academic community to deal with student plagiarism, 
although methods of detection have found their way into the 
commercial world, e.g. measuring software reuse and 
identifying reused code (see, e.g. (Hislop,1998)).
I sometimes like to admit, I landed a job with a company I could finally call

my 10-year anniversary with the company, I received a letter from the chairman. He congratulated me on my decade with the company and looked forward to even more success for me in the coming years.
Six weeks later I was laid off.
I took stock of the situation and decided that, at the age of 36, I had
enough. Newspapers term guys like me The Missing Million. We are the ones
who, for whatever reason, leave their jobs and decide not to go back into the
workforce. We
