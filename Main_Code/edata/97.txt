time. A downward breakout follows a partial rise 83% of the time. I did not
split the numbers into bull or bear markets.
When a partial decline occurs, does performance suffer? Yes and no.
Using the top of the rectangle as the breakout price, the average rise in a bull
market from rectangles showing partial declines is 51% compared to 44% for
rectangles without partial declines. The results flip for rectangles in a bear
market, perhaps due to the low sample count.
Partial rises had the same effect on rectangles with downward breakouts,
but the results were not as dramatic.
Pre-formation rise or drop. Figure 37.4 shows a pre-formation rise, a
brief spike or overshoot before the start of the rectangle. In all market conditions and breakout directions, rectangles performed better when a preformation rise was absent.
Figure 37.1 shows a pre-formation drop, a brief dip before the rectangle.
In most cases, rectangles with a pre-formation drop tended to perform better
than did those without a pre-formation drop. The only exception was for rectangles in a bear market with an upward breakout.
Do I think these results are meaningful? No. I cannot see the connection
between a brief spike or decline before a rectangle begins to the postbreakout
performance. While the results in Table 37.8 are interesting, they may have little trading application.
