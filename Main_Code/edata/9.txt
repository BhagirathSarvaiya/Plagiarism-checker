Acknowledgments
Perhaps several times in your life, something occurs that alters its direction.
That happened to me several years ago when I brashly submitted my first article to Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities. Much to my surprise and
delight, the editor at the time, Thom Hartle, published the work. That single
event sent me spinning off in a new direction, another career.
Nearly a dozen articles later, I called Thom and chatted with him about
an idea for a book. He steered me to Pamela van Giessen, now editorial director for John Wiley & Sons, Inc., publisher of this book. A single e-mail of my
idea to her put a new set of wheels in motion. Simple words cannot express my
thanks to these two outstanding individuals.
This is a great book made better by the tireless efforts of Bernice Pettinato
of Beehive Production Services. She did more than shepherd a 2,000 page manuscript through production. She read it and edited it without dying of boredom
while making astute suggestions. Simply, sheâ€™s the best. Thanks, Bernice.
