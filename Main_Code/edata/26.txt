Breakout. The breakout point is difficult to identify in a broadening formation as it develops. I look for the place where price pierces the up or down
trend line or makes an extended move. If price pierces the trend line, then the
penetration point becomes the breakout point. If prices move up and follow
along the top trend line without piercing it, then I backtrack to the prior minor
high and draw a horizontal line forward in time until prices cross it. When that
happens, that is the breakout point.
Let me give you an example. Consider the broadening bottom shown in
Figure 1.2. The price trend over the preceding month leading to the formation
is downward. The two trend lines outline a widening price pattern as you
would expect from a broadening formation. There are more than two minor
highs and two minor lows pictured, meeting another criterion mentioned 
in Table 1.1.
Where is the breakout? This formation is particularly easy. If you extend
the top trend line upward, you find that prices rise well above the line, signaling an upward breakout. Then it is just a matter of backtracking to the highest
minor high and drawing a horizontal line to determine the actual breakout
price. Point A marks the highest high in the formation.
