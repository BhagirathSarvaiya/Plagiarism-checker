describe it. One person is color blind so you automatically throw out whatever
he says. One says it is solid blue. Another says it is not blue at all but green,
while the third says it looks like a combination: blue-green. To each individual, blue looks like blue—just do not try to compare answers.
Developing a trading style is a lot like that. It is an individual endeavor
that has a lot in common with experience. I cannot give you experience; I can
only suggest ways to acquire your own.
If you read a chapter on a bullish chart pattern and buy the first stock
showing the pattern in a bull market, you will probably be successful. The first
trade nearly always works for the novice, maybe even the second or third one,
too. Eventually, though, someone is going to pull the rug out from under you
(who knows, maybe it occurs on the first trade). You will make an investment in
a chart pattern and the trade will go bad. Maybe you will stumble across a herd
of bad trades and get flattened. You might question your sanity, you might
question God, but one thing is for certain: Your trading style is not working.
Most people buy stocks like they buy fruit. They look at it, perhaps sniff
it, and plunk down their money. We are not talking about $1.59 here. We are
talking about thousands of dollars for part ownership in a company.
If you have ever been a board member, you know what I am talking about.
You have a fiduciary responsibility to the people who elected or appointed you
to that position. Not only should you study the material handed to you by the
staff, but you have to get out in the field and kick the tires. Do not assume that
what the staff says is always correct or represents the best solution. Question
everything but learn in the process and try to be helpful without being a pest
(I always seem to fall into the pest category). As a shareholder—an owner of the
company—should it be any different?
