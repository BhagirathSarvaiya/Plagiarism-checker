minor lows and three minor highs. A five-point reversal is also rare: I located
only 5 in the 77 broadening bottoms I examined. The price trend begins moving down in late August and reaches a low 2 days before the formation begins.
Yes, prices do move up for several days, leading to the first touch of the top
trend line, but I still consider the overall price trend to be moving down to 
the formation. Price overshooting or undershooting the formation start is
common.
This particular chart pattern shows a partial decline. Prices move down
from 26 to 24.50, then reverse course and shoot out the top. The stock reached
a high of 38.50 just over a year later.
Identification Guidelines
Table 1.1 lists the identification guidelines for broadening bottoms.
Price trend. As mentioned earlier, a declining price trend precedes a
broadening bottom. Even if prices rise just before the formation begins, ignore
it. It is still a bottom. This arbitrary designation also makes intuitive sense: A
bottom should appear at the end of a downtrend, not when prices are climbing
to the moon
