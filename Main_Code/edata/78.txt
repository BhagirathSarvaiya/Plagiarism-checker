below 30.38. At its lowest point, it closes at 29.88. That is just fifty cents below
the low, but it is enough to signal a downward breakout. Within a week of
moving below the formation low, prices shoot to 33 and continue up using a
slower trajectory.
Figure 1.3 represents what I call a 5% failure. Prices break out lower but
fail to continue moving in the breakout direction by more than 5% before
heading back up. The reverse is also true for upward 5% failures: Prices move
up by less than 5% before turning around and tumbling.
Statistics
Table 1.2 shows general statistics for the broadening bottom chart pattern.
Number of formations. I found 237 patterns in 500 stocks using data many different parse trees thereby reducing similarity and 
wrongly missing plagiarism. 
The flexibility and complexity of natural language has driven 
researchers (in many language engineering tasks, not just 
plagiarism) to apply simpler methods of similarity involving 
a minimal amount of natural language processing. As with 
detection between different programs, various methods of 
comparing texts have been investigated, as well as defining 
suitable discriminators. Most research has been directed at 
finding possible copies and collusion between members of 
a closed-set, e.g. a set of student essays. However, unlike 
detection in software code, detection of plagiarism from 
Web-based sources has also been investigated using 
methods of copy detection. 
Methods of detection originating from file comparison, 
information retrieval, authorship attribution, compression 
and copy detection have all been applied to the problem of 
plagiarism detection. For example, similarity between texts 
based on the longest common subsequence
