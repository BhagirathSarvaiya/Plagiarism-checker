The aim of this paper is to present plagiarism detection as a

All one had to do to win was pick stocks that went up and avoid stocks that

I kept this in mind when I graduated from Syracuse University with an
engineering degree and showed up early for my first professional job. Each
morning I cracked open the newspaper and plotted my stock picks on a piece
