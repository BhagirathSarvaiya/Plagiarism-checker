Focus on Failures
Figure 1.3 shows a broadening bottom failure. Prices head down and appear to
suffer a small dead-cat bounce lasting from April to August. I do not recommend taking a position in any stock that shows a dead-cat bounce regardless of
how attractive the formation looks. Obey this recommendation for 6 months
to a year while the stock recovers and management gets its house in order (or
solves the cause of whatever is ailing the stock).
In the 3 weeks before the formation appeared, prices were heading higher
in reaction to the dead-cat bounce. In June they moved horizontally from the
formation top for over a month before easing down. During this time, prices 3.2. Plagiarism detection in natural language 
In a similar way to automatic plagiarism detection in 
program code, methods of plagiarism detection in natural 
language have focused on identifying similarity between 
groups of texts, rather than across a single text. However, 
natural language is inherently more difficult to process 
automatically than program code, making detection of even 
more routine changes such as lexical or syntactic 
modifications less successful. 
Compared to program code, difficulty in processing in this 
instance is derived from at least two properties of natural 
language: (1) ambiguity, and (2) unconstrained vocabulary. 
For example, consider detecting plagiarism in which words 
are replaced by their synonyms. Machine Readable 
Dictionaries such as WordNet6
 are possible sources for 
such transformations, but because word senses are 
ambiguous, selection of the correct term is often non-trivial. 
Consider a more complex approach in which the texts are 
parsed and their syntax compared. Ambiguity in parsing 
means that the same sentence between texts can result in
