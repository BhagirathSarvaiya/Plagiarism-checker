Identification Guidelines
Table 38.1 shows identification guidelines for rectangle tops.
Rising price trend. Over the short to intermediate term, the price trend
should be leading up to the formation. This upward trend is what distinguishes
the formation from rectangle bottoms. The distinction is arbitrary; I wanted to
see if there is any difference in the way the two perform.
Horizontal trend lines. As a rectangle forms, prices rise to a resistance
level and fall back to a support area for another try. If this pattern continues,
the minor highs can be joined with a trend line drawn along the top of the formation, and another trend line can be drawn below the minor lows. The two
trend lines are horizontal or nearly so. If there is a slight tilt to the trend line,
do not worry as long as it does not disturb the overall appearance of a congestion region.
Touches. To qualify as a rectangle, prices must touch each trend line at
least twice. The touches need not alternate from one trend line to the other,
but the minor highs and lows must be distinct. You do not want to see two
touches along the top as part of the same minor high. Instead, look for two distinct hills and two valleys at a minimum.
Volume. The volume trend varies from formation to formation but usually recedes. Many of the charts accompanying this chapter show such a trend
