Founded in 1807, John Wiley & Sons is the oldest independent publishing
company in the United States. With offices in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia, Wiley is globally committed to developing and marketing print
and electronic products and services for our customers’ professional and personal knowledge and understanding.
The Wiley Trading series features books by traders who have survived or example, Table 1 shows the number of n-gram occurrences (tokens), distinct n-grams (types), the percentage of 
unique n-grams (type-token ratio) and the percentage of ngrams occurring in one text as n varies from 1 to 10 words. 
These figures are taken from 769 texts in the METER 
corpus (a restricted domain of law and court reporting texts 
- see (Clough et al.,2002b)). Note that as n increases, the 
percentage of distinct n-grams increases indicating that 
tokens become increasingly unique. Note also that the 
percentage of distinct n-grams occurring in a single file also 
increases indicating that longer n-grams are less likely to 
be shared across more than one document. 
When the
stock recovers to its old high, his trading partners sell the remainder of their
holdings. The stock tops out and rounds over. During the next month and a
half, the stock drifts down, slowly, casually. There does not appear to be a rush
for the exits—just a slow trickle as the smart money quietly folds up shop.
Then news of poor holiday sales leaks out. There is a rumor about distribution problems, merchandising mistakes, and cash flow problems. Brokerage
firms that only weeks before were touting the stock now advise their clients to
sell. The stock plummets 39% overnight.
