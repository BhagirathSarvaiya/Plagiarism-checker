All these are, no doubt,
tough jobs. A street hawker
has to labour a lot in order
to earn his living. His
profits are very meagre. He
is generally a poor man
With this small income, he
tries to make both ends
meet. Normally, a street
hawker has a cart with
three or four wheels. Poor
street hawkers have to
carry their goods on their
heads

The street hawkers mostly
carry inexpensive things.
By selling their complete
stock, they earn a very
small amount of money.

On the whole, a street
hawkers condition is
pitiable because he
wanders all day to earn his
meagre living. But, at least
he tries to make an honest
living and not begging or
stealing. We should give
due respect to the dignity
of labour which a street
hawker does

Beggars are the people who
restore to begging for alms
from other people. Beggars
can be seen at various
places. But the main areas
of their operations are the
places of pilgrimage and
worship. They squat on the
banks of the rivers, in front
of temples, churches,
mosques, gurudwaras, and
other places of hectic
activity. They roam from
street to street, from one
locality to another begging
for alms. Though they
usually accept whatever is
given to them, some
beggars can get very
irritating and aggressive.
