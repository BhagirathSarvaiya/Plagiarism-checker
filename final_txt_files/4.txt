India is a land of variety
and is inhabited by all types
of people. Jugglers are a
very common sight in India
They provide us with
amusement and fun. They
are generally found in small
towns and villages as well
as at fairs. In big cities, we
come across very few
jugglers because people
have so many other
attractions and means of
entertainment that they
show no interest in the
hackneyed tricks of the
jugglers. The working
people in particular, cannot
afford to waste their
precious time by watching
the performances of
jugglers.

A juggler, however, is most
popular among children.
They are amazed at his
wonderful tricks and
gimmicks. They consider
him to be a magician.

A juggler often paints his
face and wears bright
coloured clothes to attract
attention. He employs a
young boy who carries his
stock-in-trade in a bag or
basket. It contains the
articles that a juggler needs
for the show.

First of all, the juggler
selects a suitable place for
the performance. He
spreads a piece of cloth on
the ground and begins to
play on the flute. The boy
with him begins to beat the
drum. The juggler is adept
at playing on the flute. He
can produce different tunes
so as to attract a
sufficiently large crowd
before beginning his tricks.
He is clever, witty and
quick of movement. He
smiles with confidence
during his show. He
surprises the spectators by
his well-timed jokes and
witty remarks.

A juggler has many items
to amuse spectators. He
generally begins with the
card tricks. He can
correctly detect a card that
has been pulled out of the
pack by a spectator. He
also shows other feats.
Then, he shows ball tricks
that are very interesting
and surprising. He takes a
number of balls and throws
them up in the air in quick
succession. The balls keep
revolving in a circle

After the performance, he
goes around to make a
collection from the
spectators. A juggler is a
poor man but he tries to
make his livelihood with
honesty and labour.
